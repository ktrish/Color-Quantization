# Color-Quantization
Applied K Means Clustering to perform Color Quantization in images


Color Quantization is an essential technique for color image processing. It helps in producing the image with less number of colors with less difference from the original image. This is specially helpful for devices that can only display a limited number of colors. 
In this project, color quantization have been performed using K- Means clustering algorithm. The algorithm has been developed in pure Python.
